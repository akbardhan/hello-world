Reading an Excel data file 
```{r}
# Must Load library 'readxl'
library("readxl")
# If you know the path of the .xls or xlsk file 
#mydata1 <- read_excel("my_file.xls")
# Itâ€™s also possible to choose a file interactively
mydata2 <- read_excel(file.choose())
```

By default, read_excel would import the content of the first sheet of the file. To import other sheets, specific instructions need to be added as follows:
```{r}
# Specify sheet by its name
#mydata3 <- read_excel("my_file.xlsx", sheet = "data")
  
# Specify sheet by its index
#mydata4 <- read_excel("my_file.xlsx", sheet = 2)
```


```{r}
summary(mydata2$age)
```


Quick code to generate a histogram and a density plot

```{r}
tmp <- density(mydata2$age)
hist(mydata2$age, prob = TRUE, ylim = c(0, max(tmp$y)))
lines(tmp, col = "blue", lty = 2, lwd = 4) # lty if line type and lwd it's thickness
```
 
The following code adds little more details to the histogram.

```{r}
temp <- density(mydata2$age)
hist(mydata2$age, # histogram
 col="peachpuff", # column color
 border="black",
 freq = F, #freq = F or T (for relative frequencies (densities) or frequency resp.)
 breaks = 9,
 prob = TRUE, # show densities instead of frequencies
 xlab = "Age at admission",
 main = "Age data",
 ylab="Relative Frequency / Density",
 ylim = c(0, max(tmp$y))) #specifying ylim (sets the limits of Y-a) solves the problem of the top of density curve getting cut by title
 
lines(temp, # density plot
 lwd = 2, # thickness of line
 col = "chocolate3")
```
```{r}
head(mydata2,n = 4)
summary(mydata2$charges)
summary(mydata2$claim)
```


Two histograms side-by-side
```{r}
#png("hospitaldata.png") #output image file will be saved in the working directory
#par(oma=c(0,0,2,0))
layout(matrix(c(1:2), 2, 1,
 byrow = TRUE))
hist(mydata2$charges, # histogram
 col = "peachpuff", # column color
 border = "black",
 prob = TRUE, # show densities instead of frequencies
 #xlim = c(36,38.5),
 xlab = "Amount",
 main = "Charges")
lines(density(mydata2$charges), # density plot
 lwd = 2, # thickness of line
 col = "chocolate3")
hist(mydata2$claim, # histogram
 col = "peachpuff", # column color
 border = "black",
 prob = TRUE, # show densities instead of frequencies
 #xlim = c(36,38.5),
 xlab = "Amount",
 main = "Claim")
lines(density(mydata2$claim), # density plot
 lwd = 2, # thickness of line
 col = "chocolate3")
#dev.off()
```

```{r}
x <- rexp(1000, 0.2)
tmp <- density(x)
hist(x, prob = TRUE, ylim = c(0, max(tmp$y)))
lines(tmp, col = "blue", lty = 3, lwd = 2)
```
